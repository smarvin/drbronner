# Load order and class name collisions

If a connector has the same class as a connector that has already been registered, the new connector will be rejected. This means that connectors loaded first have precedence when two connectors share the same class name.

Tableau loads connectors by directory in the following order:
1. Built-in Tableau connectors
1. Connectors located in "My Tableau Repository/Connectors"
1. (Optional) Connectors in the dev path specified by `-DConnectPluginsPath`

# Run Your Packaged Connector (TACO file)

Starting in 2019.4, you can load packaged connectors (otherwise known as TACO files). To use a connector in earlier Tableau versions, or to run an unpackaged connector, see [Run Your "Under Development" Connector]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/run-taco#run-your-under-development-connector) below.

## Run a packaged connector in Tableau Desktop
1. Copy your packaged connector file (with a .taco filename extension) into your My Tableau Repository/Connectors directory.
1. Launch Tableau Desktop.

## Run a packaged connector in Tableau Server
### Option 1
For each machine:
1. Drop your `.taco` file into [Your Tableau Server Install Directory]/data/tabsvc/vizqlserver/Connectors. On a default install, this will be in the ProgramData folder. For example:
`C:\ProgramData\Tableau\Tableau Server\data\tabsvc\vizqlserver\Connectors`
1. Restart your server.


### Option 2
1. Create a directory for Tableau connectors. This needs to be the same path on each machine, and on the same drive as the server is installed on. For example:
`C:\tableau_connectors`
1. Copy your packaged connector file (with a .taco filename extension) into  the folder your created on each node.
1. Set the `native_api.connect_plugins_path` option. For example:

    ```
    tsm configuration set -k native_api.connect_plugins_path -v C:/tableau_connectors
    ```

    If you get a configuration error during this step, try adding the `--force-keys` option to the end of the command.

1. Apply the pending configuration changes.  This restarts the server.

    ```
    tsm pending-changes apply
    ```

    Note that whenever you add, remove, or update a connector, you need to restart the server to see the changes.

For information about using TSM to set the option, see [tsm configuration set Options](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server-linux/en-us/cli_configuration-set_tsm.htm) in the Tableau Server Help.

## Verify the signature

To be loaded in Tableau, a packaged connector must be signed by a trusted certificate.

__Note:__ Signature verification was added to Tableau Desktop in 2019.4 and Tableau Server in 2020.1.

If the connector can't be verified, you will see the following error:
`Package signature verification failed during connection creation`

This can happen because the connector is unsigned, because the certificate's trust chain does not link back to a trusted certificate authority, or because a previously valid certificate has expired.

For more information about signing a packaged connector, see [Package and Sign Your Connector for Distribution]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/package-sign) and [Signature Verification Log Entries]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/log-entries)

### Disabling signature verification

To use an unsigned packaged connector, you can disable signature verification.

- On Tableau Desktop, you use this command:
`-DDisableVerifyConnectorPluginSignature=true`

- On server, you can disable signature verification by setting  `native_api.disable_verify_connector_plugin_signature` to true via TSM.

# Run Your Under Development Connector
## Set up Tableau Desktop

__For Windows:__
1. Create a directory for Tableau connectors. For example:
`C:\tableau_connectors`
1. Put the folder containing your connector's manifest.xml file in this directory. Each connector should have its own folder. For example:
`C:\tableau_connectors\my_connector`
1. Run Tableau using the <span style="font-family: courier new">-DConnectPluginsPath</span> command-line argument, pointing to your connector directory. For example:
`tableau.exe -DConnectPluginsPath=C:\tableau_connectors`

__For macOS:__

__Note:__ In the steps below, replace [username] with your name (for example /Users/agarcia/tableau_connectors) and [version] with the version of Tableau that youâ€™re running (for example, 2019.3.app).

1. Create a directory for Tableau connectors. For example:
`/Users/[username]/tableau_connectors`
1. Put the folder containing your connector's manifest.xml file in this directory. Each connector should have its own folder. For example:
`/Users/[username]/tableau_connector/my connector`
1. Run Tableau using the `-DConnectPluginsPath` command-line argument and pointing to your connector directory. For example:
    ```
    /Applications/Tableau\ Desktop\[version].app/Contents/MacOS/Tableau -DConnectPluginsPath=/Users/[username]/tableau_connectors

    ```

## Set up Tableau Server

1. For each server node:
    - Create a directory for Tableau connectors. This needs to be the same path on each machine, and on the same drive as the server is installed on. For example:
`C:\tableau_connectors`
    - Put the folder containing your connector's manifest.xml file in this directory. Each connector should have its own folder. For example:
`C:\tableau_connectors\my_connector`

1. Set the `native_api.connect_plugins_path` option. For example:
    ```
    tsm configuration set -k native_api.connect_plugins_path -v C:/tableau_connectors
    ```
    If you get a configuration error during this step, try adding the `--force-keys` option to the end of the command.

1. Apply the pending configuration changes to restart the server:
    `tsm pending-changes apply`

    __Note:__ Whenever you add, remove, or update a connector, you must restart the server to see the changes.

For information about using TSM to set the option, see [tsm configuration set Options](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server-linux/en-us/cli_configuration-set_tsm.htm) in the Tableau Server Help.
